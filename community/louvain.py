    Perform community detection on the given node and edge data. The nodes and edges are expected
    to be provided as DataFrames, which are generated after pre-processing. `kwargs` can include 
    additional hyperparameters to fine-tune the algorithm.

    This function should also assign a community label to each node and save these labels in a static
    file for future use. Make sure to update the `config.yaml` file once the function is complete.

    NOTE: For large graphs, it is recommended to use `igraph` over `networkx` for improved performance.
